/**
 * OMIVideoCallManager - Automatic video call management
 *
 * USAGE (SIMPLE):
 *
 *   // 1. In your video call view controller's viewDidLoad:
 *   [[OMIVideoCallManager shared] setupWithRemoteView:self.remoteContainerView
 *                                           localView:self.localContainerView];
 *
 *   // 2. That's it! SDK handles everything automatically:
 *       - Detecting when call is confirmed
 *       - Setting up video streams
 *       - Handling background/foreground transitions
 *       - Recreating views when needed
 *       - Cleanup when call ends
 *
 *   // 3. Optional: Set delegate for UI updates
 *   [OMIVideoCallManager shared].delegate = self;
 *
 *   // 4. In your dealloc or when leaving video call:
 *   [[OMIVideoCallManager shared] cleanup];
 *
 *
 * CONTROLS:
 *   [[OMIVideoCallManager shared] switchCamera];     // Switch front/back
 *   [[OMIVideoCallManager shared] toggleCamera];     // On/off camera
 *   [OMIVideoCallManager shared].isCameraOn;         // Check camera state

#pragma mark - Video Recovery

 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - When video channel was destroyed due to camera failure in background
 * - When prepareForVideoDisplay() cannot recover video (win_in=-1 persists)
 * - When remote video shows black screen but audio works
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. Sends SIP re-INVITE with PJSUA_CALL_REINIT_MEDIA flag
 * 2. PJSIP recreates video channel from scratch
 * 3. After 2 seconds, calls prepareForVideoDisplay() to setup views
 *
 * NOTE: This method is called AUTOMATICALLY when win_in=-1 persists after
 * 10 retry attempts in prepareForVideoDisplay(). You only need to call this
 * manually if you want to force video recovery at a specific time.
 *
 * @return YES if re-INVITE was sent, NO if call is not in correct state

#pragma mark - Background/Foreground Handling

/**
 * Prepare video for display after app comes to foreground.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Call this method when your video call screen appears from background!
 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - In your video call ViewController's viewDidAppear:
 * - When app transitions from background to foreground with active video call
 * - After CallKit answer from background and video screen becomes visible
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
 * When answering a call from background (via CallKit), iOS cannot start
 * AVFoundation camera session while app is in background state. This causes:
 * 1. "Unable to start AVFoundation capture session" error
 * 2. Video window ID becomes invalid (wid=-1)
 * 3. Remote video shows loading forever
 *
 * This method handles proper video initialization after foreground transition.
 *
 * USAGE EXAMPLE:
 * @code
 * - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
 *     [super viewDidAppear:animated];
 *     [[OMIVideoCallManager shared] prepareForVideoDisplay];
 * }
 * @endcode
